# From Udacity's Course: How to Use Git and GitHub

Awesome course and I highly recommend it. **And it's free**. As your journey Git and GitHub with Caroline and Sarah as your
guides, you'll be asked to reflect on what you learn. Below are the questions you'll be asked to share your thoughts on.

If you're curious about Git and GitHub as version control and respository tools, then definitely take this course, even
if it's for a refresher. You'll learn tons and you'll have loads of fun. Caroline and Sarah are terrific educators. 

### Leasson 1: Questions to Ponder

1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like 
Google Docs, treat each file separately?

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

### Leasson 2: Questions to Ponder

1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

7. What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

### Leasson 3: Questions to Ponder

1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each
approach have?
