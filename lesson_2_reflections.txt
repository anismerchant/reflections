How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    +staging area is where changes which are ready to be committed are placed
    ++it helps us organize our files into logical sets that we choose to commit together

    +working directory is where one makes all of the changes to a file(s) before staging it
    +repository is where all of the files (with history of changes) is stored
