When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  +remote repository can be used to share your work and encourage collaboration
  +it also allows one to work from different computers
  +it helps to back up ones project outside of local hard drives

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    +to control flow of information to local repository
    +gives one an opportunity to review the pulls at their pace
    +if it's automatic, then one could potentially get overwhelmed with overflow of info
